Tisp 
====

My take on a small lisp like programming language. 

teo+lisp = tisp (Ï„)

tisp supports arithmetics and the o in io :^)

Run
---

    git clone https://github.com/xnacly/tisp

with a file: 

    go run . -f ./examples/helloworld.tisp

as a repl:

    go run .

Reference
---------

keyword     args    description

putv        x        prints x to stdout
add         x,y      adds x and y
sub         x,y      subtracts y from x
mul         x,y      multiplies x and y
