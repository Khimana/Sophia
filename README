Tisp 
====

My take on a small lisp like programming language. 

teo+lisp = tisp (Ï„)

tisp supports arithmetics and the o in io :^)

Run
---

    git clone https://github.com/xnacly/tisp

with a file: 

    go run . -f ./examples/helloworld.tisp

as a repl:

    go run .

Reference
---------

Hello world:

    [putv "Hello World!"]


Keyword reference:

keyword     description

putv        prints x to stdout
add         adds all arguments together
sub         subtracts all arguments
mul         multiplies x and y
div         divides x by y

All execution is done left to right, meaning
    
    [add 1 2 3] ;; results in 1+2+3 -> 6
    [sub 1 2 3] ;; results in 1-2-3-> -4


Tips supports strings and 64 bit floating point integers.
